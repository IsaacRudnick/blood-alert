For production:
Add consoleWarn.js to header. (currently commented out for development)

Check profile.ejs form input client-side before sending to server

Add token functionality to profile.ejs form / checker

Better snooze message (don't call it snooze, that implies the user will be texted after the snooze is up)
Like MS Typescript+Node example, env --> utils env that catches errors
Better form + token (check to make sure data is accessible)
If data API later can't be reached, text user
