Better snooze message (don't call it snooze, that implies the user will be texted after the snooze is up)

FORM features to implement:

- Validate input client-side, too
- Pull default settings from nightscout
- Autodetect if nightscout needs token, and if so, prompt
- Check that token works

Sync with NS settings

Text user if NS link stops working (for more than an hour?)
